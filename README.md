# AND101 Project 1 - Hello, Squirrel!

Submitted by: **Ray Simbiri**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Hello Squirrel** is an android app that recreates the common "Hello, World!", to introduce ourselves to the rest of the app dev community.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **😍👑😁**

## Application Features

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] Change profile name to your name
- [x] Change profile bio text to a personal bio about yourself
- [x] Modify hobby section to include your top three (3) hobbies

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [x] Re-brand the app by modifying the UI
- [x] Modify the profile image by uploading a new image drawable

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you added to improve the app!

## Video Demo

## Notes

Using half of the dimension of a square cardview as the corner radius yields a circular cardview.

ScaleType of centerCrop is good for profile images.

Using interword justification mode in a textview yields a better UX.
